# CS-001: Callee analysis (down the stack)

**Risk**: Lock violations, resource leaks, uninitialized variables

**When to check**: Required for all non-trivial changes

**Background knowledge:**

Read patterns/null.md for NULL pointer dereference guidance.

Note: foo->ptr dereferences foo BUT NOT ptr

null.md loaded and read? [ y / n ]

Regression analysis requires understanding both the changes made and all of
the ways those changes impact unmodified code.  This part of the prompt gathers
additional context beyond just the modified functions so that we can search
for side effects and unintended consequences that lead to regressions.

Your analysis must search for those side effects, both in modified functions
and up and down the call stack into unmodified code.

Place into TodoWrite: Task 0-6
  - Other patterns in the prompt depend on the context gathered
    by these tasks.  You must complete all of the steps in all of these tasks

# Task 0: Category iteration

Reference CHANGE CATEGORIES from review-core.md

- For EVERY category identified
- Perform Tasks 1-6 separately
- Add the category into TodoWrite
  - You must fully complete every category
- Output: Category N of M: name, description
  - Output: callers loaded: [ list, with random lines from each function ]
  - Output: callees loaded: [ list, with random lines from each function ]
- Completion of this prompt requires enumeration and completion for every category

## Task 1: **Callee traversal process**:
- Step callee.1: Identify all direct callees in modified functions
  - We gather the callees because even small changes in functions can
    cause bugs in the functions they call.  The only way to know is to
    actually read the functions in the callstack.
  - The semcode diff_functions call did not list callees, you have to find
    for each function you've already gathered
  - Place callees into TodoWrite, even if they were outside the modified part of the function
  - Place callees into TodoWrite, even if they were not modified
  - Output: names of callees
- Step callee.2: For each callee, load entire function definition
  - Output: The callee function names, and a random line from anywhere in each definition
    - you must prove you read the callee
- Step callee.3: Trace 2-3 levels deep as needed
  - Place each additional callee into TodoWrite
  - Again, small changes higher up in the stack can introduce bugs lower
    down.  You cannot analyze code effectively without looking at the call stack,
    even for changes that you think you understand.
- Step callee.4: Apply all checks below to each callee in the chain
  - Output: The callee function names, and a random line from anywhere in each definition
    - you must prove you read the callee
- Step callee.5: completing the callee analysis is not sufficient.  You must also
complete caller analysis.

## Task 2: **Caller traversal process:**
- step caller.1: identify all direct callers
  - We gather the callers because even small changes can introduce bugs
    in the functions that call them.  The only way to know is to actually
    read the functions in the callstack.
  - Place into TodoWrite, even if they were not modified
  - Output: names of callers
- step caller.2: for each caller, load function definition
  - Output: caller name, size in lines
  - Output: The caller function names, and a random line from anywhere in each definition
    - you must prove you read the callers
- step caller.3: for callers that propagate return value, trace their callers
  - Again, changes and errors can propagate up in surprising ways.  You
    need to read the callers.
  - Place additional callers into TodoWrite
  - Search caller for return value propagation higher into the stack
    - If there is potential impact to caller's callers
      - Add one level higher in the stack to TodoWrite
      - Read caller's callers full definition
      - Output caller's caller names [ list, impacted return statements ]
      - Continue recursively up the chain at most 3 levels
  - Output: caller name, return value line
- step caller.4: apply all checks in Tasks 3-7 below to every caller
  - Output: The caller function names, and a random line from anywhere in each definition
    - you must prove you read the callers
- step caller.5: continue into lock requirement analysis, even if you think you've
  found enough data to complete the analysis

## Task 3: **Mandatory Lock requirements**:
- step lock.1: Verify proper locks are held based on requirements in every tracked function
  - You MUST include callers of modified functions, even if they were not modified
  - You MUST include callees of modified functions, even if they were not modified
  - Changes in modified functions often have unintended side effects elsewhere in
      the call stack.  Your analysis must search for these unintended side effects.
  - Output: locks required
- step lock.2: Ensure functions take and release locks as expected by caller
- step lock.3: If locks are changed or dropped during the call, verify code properly revalidates state
- step lock.4: Ensure caller provides all locks required by callees
- step lock.5: continue into Task 4, even if you think you've found enough details to complete
  the analysis
- Output: Category NUMBER [ list of locks checked ]

## Task 4: **Mandatory locking in error path validation**:
- step lock.6: For every lock acquired, trace error paths ensuring locks properly released/handed off
  - You MUST include callers and callees of modified functions, even if they were not modified
  - Output: locations of all error paths
- step lock.7: Continue into Task 5, even if you think you've found enough details to complete the analysis
- Output: Category NUMBER [ error path lines ]

## Task 5: **Mandatory resource propagation validation**:

- Notes on tracking allocations:
  - In the kernel, some allocations are just removing objects from lists or arrays
  - Consider every pointer assignment a potential allocation, check for leaks and misuse
    - This includes void * pointers, which often return memory to callers
  - Output: at least 3 pointers assigned in modified functions, w/line of code

- step resource.1: Trace resource ownership through function boundaries
  - You MUST include callers and callees of modified functions, even if they were not modified
  - When resources are allocated, make sure they are somehow returned or processed before
    they are overwritten.
- step resource.2: For allocations (kmalloc/kcalloc/kzalloc/vmalloc):
  - If size parameter can be 0, report potential ZERO_SIZE_PTR crash
- step resource.3: For multiple pointers to same memory: track how writes through one affect others
  - Reference as MULTI_POINTER_MEMORY_TRACKING in later patterns
  - Output: list of pointers you found for the same memory
  - NOTE: this tracking is use in other prompts, you must perform it.
- step resource.4: Verify resources are properly initialized, locked, and freed
- step resource.5: Continue into Task 5B, even if you think you've found enough details to complete the analysis
- Output: Category NUMBER [ list of resources checked: line of code where each resource was assigned ]

## Task 5B: **Mandatory RCU ordering validation**:

**CRITICAL**: This task catches use-after-free bugs in RCU-protected data structures.

- step rcu.1: For any `call_rcu()`, `synchronize_rcu()`, or `kfree_rcu()` in the diff:
  - Load `patterns/RCU-001.md` if not already loaded
  - Output: "RCU-001.md loaded: [ y / n ]"
- step rcu.2: Identify what data structures the object is part of (rhashtable, hlist, list, rb-tree, etc.)
  - Output: "Object in data structures: [ list ]"
- step rcu.3: Verify removal from ALL lookup structures happens BEFORE call_rcu()
  - Check: is removal done in the function calling call_rcu(), or in the callback?
  - Output: "Removal location: [ before call_rcu / in callback ]"
- step rcu.4: If removal is in the callback:
  - This is the WRONG pattern - flag as use-after-free
  - New readers can find the object after the grace period but before removal
  - The callback then frees while readers are still accessing
  - Output: "RCU-001 VIOLATION: removal in callback at [location]"
- step rcu.5: Check for memory accesses between lookup and refcount acquisition
  - If there are field accesses before refcount_inc_not_zero(), these are NOT protected
  - Output: "Accesses before refcount: [ list of field accesses ]"
- step rcu.6: Continue into Task 6, even if you think you've found enough details

## Task 6: **Mandatory loop control flow validation**:

- step loop.1: Track what happens to resource-holding variables across loop iterations
- step loop.2: Assume all loops iterate multiple times, check pointer assignments for leaks and logic errors
  - pay attention to both outer and inner loops, make sure you trace both.
- step loop.3: If pointers are reassigned without consuming/freeing the previous value,
  carefully consider potential leaks.
  - Check the entire function context when pointers are reassigned.  Not just
    inner loops
- step loop.4: Compare loop exit conditions across parallel code paths (debug vs non-debug,
  error vs success) for consistency
  - Finding a single break inside a conditional path is not the same as checking
    all paths.
- step loop.5: Continue into Task 7, even if you think you've found enough details to complete the analysis
- Output: for each loop checked
  - loop start line, at least one exit line from the loop

## Task 7: **Initialization validation**

Step init.1:
  - For every function loaded into context, even if not changed by the patch
  - You MUST include callers and callees of modified functions, even if they were not modified
  - Output function name, random line
  - Check for variables and objects accessed without initialization
- Output: Category NUMBER [ list of variables properly initialized ]

## Task 8

At this point, you're going to want to mark CS-001 complete, but it's very likely
you've skipped most of the steps.  Skipping work makes the regression analysis
fail and means all of the time spent so far was wasted.  Fully process the
instructions as required by the prompt.

Output: a one line description of potential regressions you found and ruled out.

Think about potential regressions that you found and ruled out.  While you were
processing those potential regressions, you skipped steps and ignored other
potential problems.  This is a deep dive analysis, double check your work.

Output: elements of CS-001.md that you skipped because you were focused on
regressions that later you ruled out.

Even if you've already used a lot of tokens, go back and check the
skipped steps now that you know these potential regressions were safe.

- Did you put every category into TodoWrite? y/n
- Did you fully analyze and complete Tasks 1-7 for every category? y/n
- Did you fully complete each TodoWrite entry inside each step for every category? y/n

If the answer to either question was no, do not complete CS-001.  Go back and
finish analysis as instructed.
