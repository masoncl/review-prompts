subject: [PATCH bpf-next] bpf: use preempt_disable/enable() to protect bpf_bprintf_buffers nesting

Later version with fixes: N/A (v2 requested but not yet posted)

The AI bot correctly identified a preempt count underflow bug in the
error path of bpf_put_buffers(). The patch added preempt_enable() in a
WARN path where nest_level==0, meaning bpf_try_get_buffers() never
called preempt_disable(). Maintainer Yonghong Song confirmed the AI
analysis was correct and apologized for his earlier incorrect
suggestion. Sebastian Siewior proposed an alternative solution using
local_lock_t and per-task tracking instead of preemption manipulation.

Later version with fixes: N/A (not yet posted)

The AI bot correctly identified a logic error in tnum_overlap() where the
check `!(a.mask & b.mask)` incorrectly returns false for disjoint masks.
The bot provided a concrete counter-example showing tnums with disjoint
masks that actually overlap (both contain value 15). Maintainer Eduard
Zingerman confirmed this is a "legit bug" and requested it be addressed.
No v3 patch has been posted yet to fix the issue.

Later version with fixes: N/A (v6 will fix, not yet posted)

The AI bot correctly identified that the refactored code uses ctx->nr
instead of ctx->entry->nr for start_entry_idx, which breaks uprobe
trampoline fixups. The bot explained how ctx->nr and entry->nr track
different things and become out of sync when add_mark is true. Author
Tao Chen agreed: "Use ctx->entry->nr looks better, will change it."
The fix will be included in v6 of the patch series.

Later version with fixes: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20251028183032.5350-2-fmancera@suse.de/

The AI bot identified two bugs: (1) memory leak when skb_ext_add() fails
after kmem_cache_zalloc() in xsk_build_skb_zerocopy(), and (2)
uninitialized extension in xsk_build_skb() first-descriptor path. Author
acknowledged issue #2 as "a leftover" and posted v2 same day. However, v2
only fixed the uninitialized extension bug; the memory leak in
xsk_build_skb_zerocopy() remains unaddressed in the updated patch.

Later version with fixes: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20251101110717.2860949-11-a.s.protopopov@gmail.com/

The AI identified that jump_table_outside_subprog() uses a write
operation but expects a bounds-check error message. The bot suggested this
would trigger "writes into insn_array not allowed" before bounds checking.
However, author Anton clarified that "the error triggered by this test
happens before the check for the writes" and acknowledged changing it "for
better readability." In v9, the test was fixed to use a read operation.

Later version with fixes: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20251105090410.1250500-9-a.s.protopopov@gmail.com/

The AI bot correctly identified that clear_insn_aux_data() was called
after bpf_remove_insns(), causing it to check the wrong instructions when
deciding which aux_data entries to free. After instructions are removed,
insns[off] contains what was insns[off+cnt], but aux_data hasn't shifted
yet. The bot provided a detailed example showing the bug. Author Anton
agreed: "Looks plausible. I will move it upper and add a comment on the
call order." In v11, the function call was moved before bpf_remove_insns()
with a comment explaining the ordering requirement.

Later version with fixes: N/A (RFC abandoned in favor of different approach)

The AI bot correctly identified a missing error code assignment when
malloc() fails. The code changed from "return -ENOMEM" to "goto out" but
err was initialized to 0, causing malloc failure to return success. No
direct replies to the review were posted. Thread discussion focused on the
broader patch approach, and the author later proposed using an ifdef
compatibility macro for OpenSSL v1 instead of this RFC's conditional
compilation approach.

Later version with fixes: N/A (v3 not yet posted, but fix confirmed)

The AI bot identified a documentation/implementation mismatch in
bpf_mem_cgroup_usage(). The function documentation states "Returns current
memory cgroup size in bytes" but the code returns page_counter_read()
which returns pages, not bytes. The bot referenced mem_cgroup_usage() in
memcontrol-v1.c which multiplies by PAGE_SIZE for byte conversion. Author
Roman Gushchin confirmed the bug with "Yep, correct, fixed." Maintainer
Michal Hocko also acked the patch series, indicating the fix will be
incorporated in a future version.

Later version with fixes: N/A (no v2, issue rejected)

The AI bot claimed impl_by_magic_kfunc() could overflow magic_kfuncs[]
because the loop checks i < size but accesses i+1. With
BTF_ID_LIST_SIZE=1, when i=0 it would access magic_kfuncs[1] which is
out of bounds. Author Ihor noted "i += 2" prevents issues if the table
is defined correctly. Maintainer Eduard Zingerman definitively rejected
the review: "The code is fine and there is no need to bow to the AI
overlord." No v2 was posted addressing this non-issue.

Later version with fixes: N/A (not fixed in later versions)

The AI bot correctly identified that push_stack() returns NULL on all
error paths (allocation failure, copy failure, stack overflow), not
ERR_PTR. The patch used IS_ERR(branch) which evaluates to false for
NULL, causing the code to continue with a NULL pointer. The bot
provided specific line numbers and listed all 6 other call sites that
correctly check for NULL. Alexei Starovoitov confirmed: "AI is correct,
since it reviewed the patch against bpf tree where push_stack() returns
NULL." However, subsequent versions (v3, v4) kept IS_ERR unchanged.

Later version with fixes: Not yet posted (v3 will fix)

The AI bot identified a resource leak in bpf_struct_ops_link_create().
When cgroup_get_from_fd() fails, the code returns PTR_ERR(cgrp)
directly, skipping the err_out label that frees the link and map
allocated earlier. All other error paths correctly use "err = <error>;
goto err_out;" but this one returns directly. Author Roman Gushchin
confirmed: "Ok, this is indeed wrong, will fix in the next version."

Later version with fixes: Not yet posted (v3 not available)

The AI bot correctly identified a race condition between
bpf_oom_ops_unreg() and bpf_oom_memcg_offline(). Both functions can
run concurrently when userspace closes the BPF struct ops link FD while
a cgroup is being deleted. The offline function WRITE_ONCE clears
memcg->bpf_oom, then unreg tries to WARN_ON if the pointer doesn't
match. No direct responses to this review were found in the thread.

Later version with fixes: N/A (no v2 posted)

The AI bot correctly identified a node leak in bpf_common_lru_pop_free()
when raw_res_spin_lock_irqsave() fails after successfully stealing a
node from another CPU's list. The stolen node is removed from
steal_loc_l but never added to any list when the lock fails, causing it
to become orphaned. BPF maintainer Alexei Starovoitov confirmed: "AI is
right. Here and in other places you can just leak the objects.
res_spin_lock() is not a drop-in replacement. The whole thing needs to
be thought through." Author acknowledged the issue.

Later version with fixes: N/A (no later version)

The AI bot flagged missing NULL checks in bpf_program__assoc_struct_ops()
for prog and map parameters before dereferencing prog->name, prog->type,
and map->fd. The bot noted that bpf_program__set_attach_target() checks
for NULL. However, maintainer Andrii Nakryiko explained that libbpf APIs
generally do not tolerate passing NULL for bpf_program or bpf_map
pointers, stating "this is fine, this shouldn't happen with valid usage
of an API (and we don't guard against this)." The AI review was
incorrect based on libbpf API design conventions.

Later version with fixes: N/A (no v5 yet, issue acknowledged)

The AI bot identified that the comment update stating "Caller already did
skb_cow() with meta_len+len as headroom" was incorrect for all callers.
Specifically, bpf_skb_proto_4_to_6() and bpf_lwt_seg6_adjust_srh() don't
account for meta_len in their headroom calculations, which could lead to
metadata being silently cleared. Author Jakub Sitnicki responded that
bpf_skb_proto_4_to_6() is handled in the next patch (8/16) and
acknowledged bpf_lwt_seg6_adjust_srh() as a known limitation, stating
"LWT and other encap facilities are out of scope for this series" and
adding it to his TODO list. The review was correct in identifying the
issue, though part was addressed in a later patch of the same series.

The AI bot flagged that kmalloc_nolock() with gfp_flags=0 does not
charge memcg, unlike the old bpf_mem_alloc(&bpf_global_ma) which
charged the root memcg. However, maintainer Alexei Starovoitov explained
this change was intentional: v1 had __GFP_ACCOUNT but v2 removed it per
his feedback because charging random current tasks is wrong. The memcg
accounting will be revisited when non-sleepable arena allocations land.

The AI bot flagged a potential NULL pointer dereference in
bpf_get_mem_cgroup() where css->ss is accessed at line 34 before the
NULL check at line 42. However, both author Roman Gushchin and
maintainer Alexei Starovoitov explained the code is correct: the BPF
verifier guarantees pointer parameters are non-NULL due to KF_RCU
semantics. The NULL check at line 42 is for the result of
rcu_dereference_raw(), not the function parameter. Chris Mason confirmed
locally with semcode the false positive was properly identified.

The AI bot identified two issues in patch 01/11: (1) integer overflow in
insn_array_alloc_size() where u32 multiplication can wrap with large
max_entries values, and (2) incomplete handling of subprograms in
bpf_prog_update_insn_ptrs() because used_maps are not copied to subprog
aux structures. Author Anton confirmed issue #1 and converted types to
u64. For issue #2, Anton noted the fix was in a later commit but agreed
it should be moved earlier. In v11, the used_maps copying was moved to
the first patch where it belongs.

The AI bot identified three issues in patch 06/11: (1) reused overflow
bug from patch 01, (2) jt_from_map() not updating jt->cnt after
copy_insn_array_uniq() returns actual count leading to uninitialized
memory access, and (3) PTR_TO_INSN regsafe() not checking map_ptr
equality allowing incorrect state pruning. Author Anton acknowledged he
missed updating jt->cnt and agreed to add the count update. For the
map_ptr check, Anton confirmed it should be added to prevent incorrect
equivalence between pointers to different maps. All issues were fixed in
v11 of the patch series.

Later version with fixes: N/A (fixed in patch 4/6 of same series)

The AI bot correctly identified that ftrace_mod_address_lookup() sets
*modname but doesn't initialize *modbuildid, leaving buildid
uninitialized when append_buildid() is called. The bot provided detailed
analysis of all three lookup functions and noted the uninitialized memory
could be read. Author Petr Mladek confirmed this was "a great analyze"
and explained the patchset fixes this bug in patch 4/6. Alexei
Starovoitov noted AI currently analyzes patches one at a time like humans
reading incrementally, and teaching AI to understand whole series is on
the TODO list.

Later version with fixes: N/A (rejected, no v2 posted)

The AI bot correctly identified that 8 bpf_map_* functions documented
incorrect return values. The documentation stated "-1 on failure with
errno set" but the implementation uses libbpf_err_errno() which returns
negative errno values directly (e.g., -EINVAL, -ENOENT). The bot cited
existing batch operation docs that correctly document "negative error
code" as evidence. Author Jianyun Gao acknowledged: "I will fix it in
the next version." However, maintainer Alexei Starovoitov rejected the
entire patch series calling it "AI generated garbage" after the author
admitted using AI assistance for the documentation.

Later version with fixes: N/A (v6 not yet posted, fixes planned)

The AI bot identified three types of issues across the patch series:
(1) Out-of-bounds array access in btf__permute - author Donglin
acknowledged and agreed to fix. (2) NULL pointer dereference in strcmp
calls and missing nr_sorted_types updates - author explained these were
false positives as binary search is disabled until patch 4/7 adds the
validation. (3) Race conditions on btf->nr_sorted_types concurrent
writes and const-cast undefined behavior in patch 6/7 - team discussed
solutions including WRITE_ONCE/READ_ONCE or moving sorting to build
time. Overall: 2 correct (memory issue + race condition), 2 incorrect
(false positives from incremental patch review).

Later version with fixes: N/A (patch merged in v11, issue was incorrect)

The AI bot flagged that patch 02/12 only updates bpftool documentation
but doesn't update libbpf's map_type_name[] array, which would cause
bpftool to display "type 39" instead of "insn_array" for the new map
type. However, author Anton Protopopov explained "It's done in an
adjacent commit" (patch 03/12). The AI review failed to consider that
this was part of a multi-patch series where functionality was
deliberately split across patches. The series was applied to bpf-next.
A second AI review on patch 04/12 found a correct logic error (checking
prog_fd instead of extra_fd) that author acknowledged but wasn't fixed
before the v11 series was merged to bpf-next.

The AI bot correctly identified that ASSERT_OK_PTR was checking btf5
instead of btf6 after btf6 was assigned from btf__parse_split(). The
line above assigns to btf6, but the assertion checked btf5 which was
already validated earlier. Maintainer Andrii Nakryiko confirmed: "AI has
a good point, I fixed it up while applying." Author posted v3 same day

additional cleanup issues with uninitialized btf4/btf5 and unlink calls
that were also fixed in v3.

The AI flagged patch 02/12 for not updating libbpf's map_type_name[]
array. Author Anton replied the update was "done in an adjacent commit"

with deliberately split functionality. A second AI review on patch
04/12 correctly identified checking prog_fd instead of extra_fd. Anton
confirmed "Indeed, the extra_fd should be checked" but v11 merged

Later version with fixes: N/A (v3 not yet posted, fix confirmed)

The AI bot correctly identified a type mismatch in read_cgroup_file()
where the function returns size_t (unsigned) but tries to return -1 on
error and assigns read() result (ssize_t) to size_t variable ret. This
causes -1 to become SIZE_MAX when converted to unsigned, breaking error
handling for callers checking "if (ret < 0)". Author Roman Gushchin
responded "Correct, fixed to ssize_t. Thanks!" confirming both issues.
No v3 posted yet but fix is confirmed for next version.

Later version with fixes: N/A (RFC series still in review)

The AI bot correctly identified that the refcnt field in struct
bpf_async_cb is never initialized before use. The structure is allocated
via bpf_map_kmalloc_nolock() which uses kmalloc (not kzalloc), leaving
memory uninitialized. The bot noted that bpf_async_tryget() and
bpf_async_put() call refcount_inc_not_zero() and refcount_dec_and_test()
on the uninitialized refcnt field. Maintainer Alexei Starovoitov agreed:
"I have to agree with AI. It's better to move refcount_set(&cb->refcnt,
1); from patch 5 to this patch. Squashing both is an option too."

[1] when applying on bpf-next." The author deliberately created a patch
that depends on another series being applied first. The AI review
correctly identified the technical issue but missed that this was
documented intentional behavior. No replies were posted to the review.

btf->nr_types, which author Donglin acknowledged and agreed to fix. For
patch 3/7, it flagged NULL strcmp calls and missing nr_sorted_types
updates, but author explained these were false positives as binary
search is disabled until patch 4/7. For patch 6/7, it correctly
identified race conditions on concurrent btf->nr_sorted_types writes and
const-cast undefined behavior. The team (Eduard, Alexei, Ihor) decided
to move BTF sorting to build-time in resolve_btfid instead, eliminating
the need for lazy checking. Author plans to fix identified issues in v6.

BTF_ID_LIST, BTF_ID, BTF_SET_START have fallback definitions in the

fallbacks, code using these macros will fail to compile when
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF is disabled. Author Ihor Solodrai confirmed:
"Indeed. Kernel build fails with CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=n. Good bot."

The AI bot correctly identified an uninitialized variable bug where the
'supported' variable could be read without initialization if
is_adjust_tail_supported() returned an error. When the function returns
early from either data_map check or bpf_map_lookup_elem() failure, it
doesn't set *supported, but the code unconditionally checks "if
(!supported)" afterwards, reading uninitialized stack memory. Author
Bastien fixed this in v7 by changing the logic to use "else if
(!supported)" instead, properly handling the error case. No direct

t->bpf_psi, Thread B can complete unreg, free the bpf_psi object, then
Thread A accesses freed memory via srcu_read_lock(). The bot correctly

A has pinned the trigger, but B unconditionally frees bpf_psi even when
all triggers were pinned. No replies were posted to this AI review.

--clm it's not clear if AI's race condition was real.  Probably not.

The AI bot identified data race issues with btf->nr_sorted_types and
const-cast undefined behavior in btf_check_sorted(). Multiple threads
can call btf_find_by_name_kind() concurrently without locks, leading to
race conditions on nr_sorted_types writes. Author Donglin asked if using
WRITE_ONCE/READ_ONCE or atomic_try_cmpxchg would address this. Maintainer
Eduard confirmed const-casting is undefined behavior per C standard.
However, Alexei stated Ihor will move BTF sorting into resolve_btfid
during build time, eliminating the need for lazy checking and avoiding
the race condition entirely. Author plans to implement non-lazy sorting
in v6 based on team decision.

another thread could call bpf_prog_disassoc_struct_ops() and free the map
between the READ_ONCE and the refcount increment. However, author Amery
clarified this is safe because struct_ops maps wait for an RCU grace
period before freeing, ensuring bpf_map_inc_not_zero() will fail safely if
the map is being freed. The AI review was incorrect due to missing context
about RCU protection guarantees in the struct_ops subsystem.

Later version with fixes: N/A (no v2 posted, issue remains unclear)

The AI bot identified that reverting the 2019 fix might re-introduce a BPF
selftest failure by not storing regs->ip from perf_arch_fetch_caller_regs.
Josh Poimboeuf agreed and requested validation. Author Jiri Olsa explained
the test passes because it doesnt check IPs directly, only compares stacks.
Testing showed the revert causes duplicate first entries in stack traces
but no test failures. Josh requested better commit message explaining why
reverting a fix is safe. Discussion revealed uncertainty about what changed
since 2019 to make the original fix redundant. The AI review was partially
correct - it identified valid technical concerns that led to productive
discussion about commit clarity, though the practical impact was benign.

Later version with fixes: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20251104215405.168643-5-jolsa@kernel.org/

The AI bot correctly identified an inverted error check in
test_stacktrace_ips_raw_tp(). The code used "if (ASSERT_OK(err, ...))"
which jumps to cleanup on success instead of failure, causing the test to
skip on success and continue with invalid data on failure. Author Jiri
Olsa confirmed: "ugh, it is.. will fix it in next version." The bug was
fixed in v3 posted the next day by changing to "if (!ASSERT_OK(err,
...))". The error check pattern was inconsistent with the function at line
70 that correctly used the negated form.

Later version with fixes: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20251104203309.318429-3-alan.maguire@oracle.com/

The AI bot correctly identified potential NULL dereference in the
comparison loop where btf__type_by_id(btf3, i) could return NULL if
btf6 has more types than btf3, causing memcmp to dereference NULL.
Author Alan Maguire agreed and asked if he should respin. Maintainer
Alexei Starovoitov confirmed yes and suggested adding an ASSERT_EQ to
check type counts match. In v4 posted same day, both fixes were
implemented: ASSERT_EQ check for equal type counts, and ASSERT_OK_PTR
NULL checks for both btf__type_by_id calls before using in memcmp.

Later version with fixes: N/A (v11 series merged to bpf-next)

The AI bot correctly identified that in check_no_map_reuse() the final
correctness check validates prog_fd instead of extra_fd after loading a
program into extra_fd. The check should verify extra_fd >= 0 but
incorrectly checks prog_fd which was already validated earlier. Author
Anton confirmed: "Indeed, the extra_fd should be checked" but the v11
series was merged without fixing this bug. A second AI review on patch
02/12 incorrectly flagged missing libbpf updates, which the author
explained were in the next patch of the series.

Later version with fixes: N/A (v5 not yet posted, but fix confirmed)

The AI bot correctly identified that removing the add_mark parameter
from get_perf_callchain() and hardcoding it to true changes BPF stack
map behavior. Previously BPF passed false to exclude PERF_CONTEXT marker
values, but the refactored code unconditionally adds markers that will
break bpf_get_stackid() hashing and insert unexpected sentinel values
into stack traces. Author Tao Chen acknowledged the issue and agreed to
preserve the parameter in v5. Maintainer Yonghong Song confirmed the bug
with a detailed crash trace showing KASAN detecting buffer overflow when
markers are included unexpectedly.

Later version with fixes: N/A (no v3 posted yet)

The AI bot identified an issue with uninitialized gfp_mask in the new
bpf_out_of_memory() function causing early return in out_of_memory()
for system-wide OOMs. The bot noted that with gfp_mask=0 and memcg=NULL
the check "!(oc->gfp_mask & __GFP_FS) && !is_memcg_oom(oc)" evaluates
to true, returning without invoking the OOM killer. No direct responses
to this review were found in the thread. Human reviewers Michal Hocko
discussed other aspects of the patch but did not address the gfp_mask
issue. The review appears to be a false positive as memcg-scoped OOMs
bypass the check.

--clm This review was correct, Roman did reply.  Fixed the accounting to "yes"

Later version with fixes: N/A (v6 will fix, not yet posted)

The AI bot identified two issues: (1) unnecessary bpf_map_put() call in
bpf_prog_get_assoc_struct_ops() error path that creates refcount
imbalance, and (2) potential race condition with
bpf_prog_disassoc_struct_ops(). Author Amery agreed the bpf_map_put()
was an artifact from v4 and will be removed. For the race condition,
author explained it's safe because struct_ops programs are protected by
RCU grace periods. The bot correctly caught one real bug and one
non-issue due to missing RCU context understanding.

Later version with fixes: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20251105151407.12723-3-leon.hwang@linux.dev/

The AI bot incorrectly claimed __insert_in_list() has a use-after-free
bug where dropping m after bpf_kptr_xchg() would free an object still
referenced by the map. Maintainer Alexei Starovoitov explained the AI
was confused by variable reuse: n holds the OLD object after xchg, so
the error path is correct. However, Alexei agreed the code was
confusing and requested clearer variable names. Author Leon posted v6
with renamed variables (node_new, node_ref, node_old) for clarity.

at the end. The bot noted this violates POSIX text file conventions and
git warns about it, though it's not a functional issue. This is the
only AI review in the thread. No replies have been posted yet to

Later version with fixes: N/A (no v8 posted)

The AI bot identified incomplete cleanup in xsk_reattach_xdp() where if
xsk_attach_xdp_program() succeeds but the subsequent xsk_is_in_mode()
check fails, the newly attached XDP program remains attached to the
interface while the function returns an error. The bot noted that ifobj
state is updated after all checks pass, but the XDP program cleanup is
missing on this error path. No replies were posted to this review, and
no later versions of the patch series were submitted.
