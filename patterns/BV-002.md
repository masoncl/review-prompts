# BV-002: Integer overflow/underflow/truncation before use

**Risk**: Buffer overflow/logic error

**When to check**: Mandatory when integer arithmetic or type conversions occur

Place each step defined below into TodoWrite.

**Mandatory integer safety validation:**
- step 1: read full function definition
  - Add function into TodoWrite
  - Output: function name, and a random line from anywhere in the definition
    - you must prove you read the function
- step 2: check all integer operations in modified functions, even if they didn't change
- step 3: watch for implicit type conversions when assigning to smaller types (u64 → u32, u32 → u16, etc.)
  - Output: list each conversion found with source and destination types
- step 4: check 16/32-bit arithmetic before array access or calculations
  - Output: list each arithmetic operation checked
- step 5: check every assignment for truncation issues, tracing types of both sides
  - Output: list each assignment with its types (e.g., "u64 x = u32_val at file:line")
- step 6: don't worry about casts between u32 -> int
- step 7: if you think a variable can overflow over time, make sure the period of time required is a practical concern

**After analysis:** Issues found: [none OR list]
