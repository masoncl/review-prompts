# SR-001: Subjective Review

**Risk**: None, subjective code quality assessment

**When to check**: mandatory for all non-trivial commits

IMPORTANT: never flag single dumb grammar changes: ex its vs it's, unless you
have a collection of them that make the commit message/comment hard to understand

**Pattern-specific TodoWrite fields**:

- commit message [full text]
- changed hunks [list]

**Basic validation**
- Is the code clean and easy to understand?
  - the kernel is full of complex and difficult code, compare new changes with nearby code when judging
- Is there a less complex approach that could solve the problem?

**Mandatory code duplication analysis**
- Look for duplicated code inside the changes being made
- Look for existing related functions that have been duplicated by the diff

**Mandatory API analysis**
- If new APIs are introduced
  - are they consistent in structure and expectations with existing APIs
  - are the functions consistent in naming and argument order
  - are the locking and allocation/free expectations clear and well documented?
- If existing APIs are used
  - is the usage diving into internal/private fields that are not meant for consumption?

**Mandatory commit message validation**
- Compare commit title and message against actual code changes
- Verify the changelog is complete (describes all significant changes)
- Verify the changelog is concise (no unnecessary verbosity)
- Check that the "why" is explained, not just the "what"
- Flag missing context that would help reviewers/maintainers

**Mandatory Self-verification gate:**

**Pattern-specific questions** (in addition to core questions):
  1. How many hunks did you check for subjective review problems? [number]
  2. How many subjective issues did you find in the commit message? [number]

If you cannot answer ALL questions with evidence, RESTART SR-001 from the beginning.
