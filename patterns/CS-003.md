# CS-003: Cross-function data flow

**Risk**: Logic error

**When to check**: Mandatory when variables passed between functions, or data format changes, or encoding changes

Place each step defined below into TodoWrite.

**Mandatory full lifecycle tracking**:
- step 1: Track variable through ENTIRE lifecycle: set → store → read → use
  - Add every variable to TodoWrite
  - Output: variable name, and the trace path (e.g., "set@file:line → store@file:line → read@file:line")
    - you must show each step in the lifecycle
- step 2: Read full definitions of functions receiving modified variables
  - Add function name to TodoWrite
  - Output: function name, and a random line from anywhere in each definition
    - you must prove you read the function
- step 3: Verify all consumers properly updated for any encoding or format changes
  - Output: list each consumer and whether it was updated or already correct
- step 4: Check both modified and unmodified code paths for producer/consumer consistency
  - Output: list paths checked and their consistency status

**After analysis:** Issues found: [none OR list]
