# CL-007: Cleanup ordering

**Risk**: Use-after-free

**When to check**: Mandatory when resources are cleaned up

**Pattern-specific TodoWrite fields**:
- Resources cleaned: [list]
- Cleanup ordering: Step 1 [Stop users - how], Step 2 [Wait completion - how], Step 3 [Destroy resources - order]
- Ordering correct: [YES/NO + explanation]

**Mandatory cleanup ordering validation:**
- verify cleanup follows proper ordering: Stop users → wait completion → destroy resources

**Mandatory Self-verification gate:**

**Pattern-specific questions**:
  1. How many resource cleanups did you find? [number]
  2. How many cleanups have incorrect ordering? [number]

If you cannot answer ALL questions with evidence, RESTART CL-007 from the beginning.
