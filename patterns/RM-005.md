# RM-005: List removal with proper handling

**When to check**: mandatory when removing resources from lists (ex: list_del())

**Risk**: Memory leak

Place each step defined below into TodoWrite.

**Mandatory list removal validation:**
- step 1: check all list removals in modified functions, even if they didn't change
  - Add every list removal to TodoWrite
  - Output: list removal line and location
- step 2: when objects are removed from lists, make sure they are returned, freed, or otherwise not lost

**After analysis:** Issues found: [none OR list]
