# RM-005: List removal with proper handling

**When to check**: mandatory when removing resources from lists (ex: list_del())

**Pattern-specific TodoWrite fields**:
**Risk**: Memory leak


- Object removed: [name] - [type]
- Object handling after removal: [freed/returned/tracked/LOST]

**Mandatory list removal validation:**
- when objects are removed from lists, make sure they are returned,
freed, or otherwise not lost
- track every list removal from modified functions in the TodoWrite, even if they didn't change

**Mandatory Self-verification gate:**

**Pattern-specific questions** (in addition to core questions):
  1. How many list removals did you find? [number]
  2. How many removed objects are lost? [number]

If you cannot answer ALL questions with evidence, RESTART RM-005 from the beginning.
