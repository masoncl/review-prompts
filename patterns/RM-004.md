# RM-004: Object state preservation in reassignment

**When to check**: mandatory when overwrite pointers to allocated memory

**Risk**: Memory leak

**Common location**: foo = func(foo) patterns

Place each step defined below into TodoWrite.

**Mandatory reassignment validation:**
- step 1: check all pointer assignments in modified functions, even if they didn't change
  - Add every pointer assignment to TodoWrite
  - Output: quote the actual assignment code and its location
- step 2: when assigning over a pointer, make sure we don't accidentally lose track of the previous object

**After analysis:** Issues found: [none OR list]
