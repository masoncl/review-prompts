# RM-004: Object state preservation in reassignment

**When to check**: mandatory when overwrite pointers to allocated memory

**Pattern-specific TodoWrite fields**:
**Risk**: Memory leak

**Common Location**: foo = func(foo) patterns


- Original pointer: [name] - [type] - [points to what]
- New value: [where from]
- Original object handling: [freed/returned/tracked/LOST]

**Mandatory reassignment validation:**
- when assigning over a pointer, make sure we don't accidentally
lose track of the previous object.
- track all assignments in modified functions in the TodoWrite, even if they didn't change

**Mandatory Self-verification gate:**

**Pattern-specific questions** (in addition to core questions):
  1. How many pointer reassignments did you find? [number]
  2. How many assignments lose track of the original object? [number]

If you cannot answer ALL questions with evidence, RESTART RM-004 from the beginning.
