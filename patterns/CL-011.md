# CL-011: Error handling locks

**Risk**: Incorrect locking

**When to check:** Mandatory when locks are acquired

Place each step defined below into TodoWrite.

**Mandatory error path locking validation:**
- step 1: read entire function when locks acquired
  - Add function into TodoWrite
  - Output: function name, and a random line from anywhere in the definition
    - you must prove you read the function
- step 2: check all locks and error paths in modified functions, even if they didn't change
  - Add every lock into TodoWrite
  - Quote the actual code where every lock was acquired
  - Add every error path into TodoWrite
  - Output: quote the actual lock acquisition and error path code
- step 3: for every lock acquired, check all error paths ensure locks properly released or handed off

**After analysis:** Issues found: [none OR list]

**Note**: For tracing error paths through callees, see CS-001
