# CL-011: Error handling locks

**Risk**: Incorrect locking

**When to check:** Mandatory when locks are acquired

**Pattern-specific TodoWrite fields**:
- Locks acquired: [name] at [line]
- Error paths: [goto/return at line] - locks released [YES/NO - which locks]

**Mandatory error path locking validation:**
- read entire function when locks acquired
- track every lock acquired in modified functions in TodoWrite, even if they didn't change
- track every error path in modified functions in TodoWrite, even if they didn't change
- for every lock acquired, check all error paths ensure locks properly released or handed off

**Mandatory Self-verification gate:**

**Pattern-specific questions**:
  1. Have you traced ALL error paths in EVERY function? [yes/no]
  2. How many error paths have unreleased locks? [number]

If you cannot answer ALL questions with evidence, RESTART CL-011 from the beginning.

**Note**: For tracing error paths through callees, see CS-001
