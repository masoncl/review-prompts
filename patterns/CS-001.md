# CS-001: Callee analysis (down the stack)

**Risk**: Lock violations, resource leaks, uninitialized variables

**When to check**: Required for all non-trivial changes

**Pattern-specific TodoWrite fields**:
- Call chain traced (2-3 levels deep): Level 1: [funcA] -> [funcB at line], Level 2: [funcB] -> [funcD]
- Lock requirements per function: [funcB] requires [locks] - [caller provides? YES/NO]
- Error paths traced through functions: [path through chain] - [locks handled? YES/NO]
- Resource propagation: [name] - initialized/locked/freed [YES/NO] - [final location]
- Variable/field initialization: [name] - [initialized before use? YES/NO] - [where]

**Callee traversal process**:
- Step 1: Always identify all direct callees in modified functions, track in TodoWrite
- Step 2: For each callee, always load entire function definition
- Step 3: Always trace 2-3 levels deep, adding callees to TodoWrite as discovered
- Step 4: Always apply all checks below to each callee in the chain
- Step 5: Add the modified function to the TodoWrite so all of these checks happen there as well

**Mandatory Lock requirements**:
- You must always verify proper locks are held based on requirements in every tracked function
- track lock requirements found for each function in TodoWrite
- track all lock requirements, even if they didn't change
- ensure functions take and release locks as expected by caller
- ensure caller provides all locks required by callees

**Mandatory locking in error path validation**:
- For every lock acquired, you must trace every error path through tracked functions, ensuring locks properly released/handed off
- track in the TodoWrite each error path traced through all tracked functions
- track in the TodoWrite all error paths in all functions tracked, even if they didn't change
- ensure locks are freed or held as required by the call stack

**Mandatory resource propagation validation**:
- You must trace resource ownership through function boundaries (where does resource end up?)
- track in TodoWrite each resource flow through tracked functions
- track in TodoWRite all resources through tracked functions, even if they didn't change
- verify resources are properly initialized
- verify resources are properly locked and unlocked
- verify resources are properly freed

**Mandatory initialization delegation**:
- You must ensure variables and fields are initialized before reading
- track in TodoWrite each variable/field and initialization status per function tracked
- track in TodoWrite all initializations through tracked functions, even if they didn't change
- verify initialization before read
- track in TodoWrite uninitialized variables into tracked functions and verify they initialize before use
- track in TodoWrite uninitialized variables received from callers and verify initialization before use

**Mandatory Self-verification gate:**

**Pattern-specific questions**:
  1. Have you traced 2-3 levels deep for EVERY modified function? [yes/no]
  2. How many callees have missing lock requirements? [number]
  3. Have you traced ALL error paths through callees for lock handling? [yes/no]
  4. How many resources are not properly initialized/locked/freed? [number]
  5. How many variables/fields are used before initialization? [number]

If you cannot answer ALL questions with evidence, RESTART CS-001 from the beginning.
