# CL-005: Memory ordering for lockless access

**Risk**: Data corruption

**When to check**: Mandatory when shared fields accessed without locks

**Pattern-specific TodoWrite fields**:
- Field: [name] - [type]
- Access type: [read/write]
- READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE used: [YES/NO]

**Mandatory memory ordering validation:**
- use READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE for shared fields accessed without locks

**Mandatory Self-verification gate:**

**Pattern-specific questions** (in addition to core questions):
  1. How many lockless shared field accesses did you find? [number]
  2. How many accesses lack READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE? [number]

If you cannot answer ALL questions with evidence, RESTART CL-005 from the beginning.
