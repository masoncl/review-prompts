# EH-005: Required interface handling

**Risk**: NULL deref

**When to check**: Mandatory when ops structs, new, changed, or any calls of ops struct members are found

**Pattern-specific TodoWrite fields**:
- Ops struct: [name] - [type]
- Change: [new functions added/optionalâ†’mandatory]
- Expectations: [function name] - [now mandatory? YES/NO]
- All providers: [location] - [meets expectations? YES/NO]

**Mandatory interface validation:**
- when expectations change for ops structs:
  - new functions added
  - previously optional functions now mandatory
- find all providers of the ops structs, track in TodoWrite
- ensure all providers meet new expectations

**Mandatory Self-verification gate:**

**Pattern-specific questions** (in addition to core questions):
  1. How many ops struct changes did you find? [number]
  2. Have you found ALL providers for EVERY ops struct? [yes/no]
  3. How many providers do NOT meet new expectations? [number]

If you cannot answer ALL questions with evidence, RESTART EH-005 from the beginning.
