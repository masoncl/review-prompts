# EH-005: Required interface handling

**Risk**: NULL deref

**When to check**: Mandatory when ops structs, new, changed, or any calls of ops struct members are found

Place each step defined below into TodoWrite.

**Mandatory interface validation:**
- step 1: when expectations change for ops structs:
  - new functions added
  - previously optional functions now mandatory
  - Add ops struct name and location to TodoWrite
  - Output: name and location
- step 2: find all providers of the ops structs
  - You'll need to search broadly in the sources, there may be dozens
  - Add every provider into TodoWrite
  - Output: list of providers
- step 3: ensure all providers meet new expectations

**After analysis:** Issues found: [none OR list]
