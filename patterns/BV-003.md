# BV-003: Logic change completeness

**Risk**: Incorrect behavior

**When to check**: Mandatory for all non-trivial changes

Place each step defined below into TodoWrite.

**Mandatory logic completeness validation:**
- step 1: read full function definition
  - Output: function name, and a random line from anywhere in the definition
    - you must prove you read the function
- step 2: check all logic in modified functions, even if they didn't change
- step 3: check changes against original condition-by-condition
  - Output: list each change with its location (e.g., "condition X at file:line")
- step 4: check changes against the intent described in the commit message
- step 5: verify ALL boolean conditions are correct
  - Output: list each boolean condition checked with its location
- step 6: for flag/constant changes: Trace what values are used in the documented problem case, not all theoretical values
  - theoretical bugs should not be flagged
- step 7: check if A && B became just B (logic weakening without explanation)

**After analysis:** Issues found: [none OR list]
