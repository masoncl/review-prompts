# BV-003: Logic change completeness

**Risk**: Incorrect behavior

**When to check**: Mandatory for all non-trivial changes

**Pattern-specific TodoWrite fields**:
- Original code: [exact snippet]
- New code: [exact snippet]
- Commit message intent: [what commit says]
- Boolean conditions: [original] vs [new] - [correct/incorrect + reason]
- Logic weakening: [YES/NO] If YES [explained in commit?]
- Flags/constants changed: [list with traced values in problem case]

**Mandatory logic completeness validation:**
- read full function definition
- track every change in modified functions in the TodoWrite, even if they didn't change
- check changes against original condition-by-condition
- check changes against the intent described in the commit message
- verify ALL boolean conditions are correct
- for flag/constant changes: Trace what values are used in the documented problem case, not all theoretical values
  - theoretical bugs should not be flagged
- check if A && B became just B (logic weakening without explanation)

**Mandatory Self-verification gate:**

**Pattern-specific questions**:
  1. How many logic changes did you find? [number]
  2. How many changes have incorrect boolean conditions? [number]
  3. Have you compared EVERY change against the commit message intent? [yes/no]
  4. Have you checked for unexplained logic weakening in EVERY change? [yes/no]

If you cannot answer ALL questions with evidence, RESTART BV-003 from the beginning.
