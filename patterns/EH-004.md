# EH-004: Return value changes handled

**Risk**: Wrong returns

**When to check**: Mandatory when return values or types change

**Pattern-specific TodoWrite fields**:
- Return type: [type]
- All return statements: [value/expression] at [line] - [correct? YES/NO]

**Mandatory return value validation:**
- read entire function for every modified function, track every return statement in TodoWrite, even if they didn't change
- verify ALL return statements in modified function are correct

**Mandatory Self-verification gate:**

**Pattern-specific questions**:
  1. Have you verified ALL return statements in EVERY function? [yes/no]
  2. How many return statements are incorrect? [number]

If you cannot answer ALL questions with evidence, RESTART EH-004 from the beginning.

**Note**: For recursive caller analysis and return value propagation, see CS-002
