# EH-004: Return value changes handled

**Risk**: Wrong returns

**When to check**: Mandatory when return values or types change

Place each step defined below into TodoWrite.

**Mandatory return value validation:**
- step 1: read entire function for every modified function
  - Add every function into TodoWrite
  - Output: function name, and a random line from anywhere in each definition
    - you must prove you read the function
- step 2: check all return statements in modified functions, even if they didn't change
  - Add every return statement into TodoWrite
  - Output: return statement and location
- step 3: verify ALL return statements in modified function are correct

**After analysis:** Issues found: [none OR list]

**Note**: For recursive caller analysis and return value propagation, see CS-001
