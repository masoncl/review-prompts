# SM-001: State machine completeness

**Risk**: Invalid state/infinite loop

**When to check**: Mandatory when state or flag variables are modified

Place each step defined below into TodoWrite.

**Mandatory state machine validation:**
- step 1: read entire function
  - Output: function name, and a random line from anywhere in the definition
    - you must prove you read the function
- step 2: check all state/flag usage in modified functions, even if they didn't change
  - Output: state flags checked
- step 3: verify ALL relevant functions check new flags
- step 4: ensure all paths handle new states/flags (read full function definitions)
- step 5: check new stop flags in existing loops

**After analysis:** Issues found: [none OR list]
