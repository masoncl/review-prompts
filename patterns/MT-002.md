# MT-002: Size Conversion Patterns

**Risk**: Data loss

**When to check:** Mandatory when bytes converted to pages (round down) `size >> PAGE_SHIFT` (only when truncation intended)

Place each step defined below into TodoWrite.

**Mandatory size conversion validation:**
- step 1: read entire function
  - Track every function in TodoWrite
  - Output function name
- step 2: check all size conversions in modified functions, even if they didn't change
  - Track every size conversion in TodoWrite
  - Output size conversion line of code
- step 3: determine the alignment of sizes sent through rounding functions, make sure nothing is lost
- step 4: check for alignment validation of the data represented, not just size validation
- step 5: track the alignment of both memory allocated and the size field itself

**After analysis:** Issues found: [none OR list]
