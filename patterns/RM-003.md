# RM-003: No access after release/enqueue

**When to check**: mandatory when we free resources or hand them over to asynchronous workers

**Pattern-specific TodoWrite fields**:
**Risk**: Use-after-free

**Common Location**: Async callbacks, after enqueue operations


- Operation: [free/enqueue]
- Resource: [name] - [type]
- Code after operation: [any reads/writes to freed/enqueued memory]
- Access after release: [YES/NO - describe if YES]

**Mandatory access-after-release validation:**
- track every free/enqueue in changed functions, even if they didn't change
- we must not read/write memory after freeing, or after handing off to workers
who will free the memory

**Mandatory Self-verification gate:**

**Pattern-specific questions** (in addition to core questions):
  1. How many free/enqueue operations did you find? [number]
  2. How many operations have access after release? [number]

If you cannot answer ALL questions with evidence, RESTART RM-003 from the beginning.
