# RM-003: No access after release/enqueue

**When to check**: mandatory when we free resources or hand them over to asynchronous workers

**Risk**: Use-after-free

**Common location**: Async callbacks, after enqueue operations

Place each step defined below into TodoWrite.

**Mandatory access-after-release validation:**
- step 1: check all free/enqueue operations in modified functions, even if they didn't change
  - Add every free/enqueue operation into TodoWrite
  - Output: variable name being freed, quote the actual free/enqueue code
- step 2: we must not read/write memory after freeing, or after handing off to workers who will free the memory

**After analysis:** Issues found: [none OR list]
