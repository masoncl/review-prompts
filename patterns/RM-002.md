# RM-002: Init-once enforcement for static resources

**Risk**: Double init

**When to check**: mandatory when static resource changes

**Common location**: Static/global initialization

**TodoWrite format** (one entry per modified function):
```
Function: [name]
Static resources:
  [res1] ([type]) at [file:line] - init-once ✓/✗ [mechanism]
  [res2] ([type]) at [file:line] - init-once ✓/✗ [mechanism]
Complex init (lock setup): ✓/✗
Issues: [none OR description]
```

Place each step defined below into TodoWrite.

**Mandatory init-once validation:**
- step 1: ensure complex initialization (ex: lock setup) is done exactly once

**After analysis:** Issues found: [none OR list]
