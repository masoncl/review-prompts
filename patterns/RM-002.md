# RM-002: Init-once enforcement for static resources

**Risk**: Double init

**When to check**: mandatory when static resource changes

**Pattern-specific TodoWrite fields**:
**Common Location**: Static/global initialization


- Resource: [name] - [type]
- Initialization: [where initialized - file:line]
- Init-once protection: [YES/NO - mechanism]
- Complex initialization: [YES/NO]

**Mandatory init-once validation:**
- ensure complex initialization (ex: lock setup) is done exactly once

**Mandatory Self-verification gate:**

**Pattern-specific questions** (in addition to core questions):
  1. How many static/global resources did you find? [number]
  2. How many resources lack init-once protection? [number]

If you cannot answer ALL questions with evidence, RESTART RM-002 from the beginning.
