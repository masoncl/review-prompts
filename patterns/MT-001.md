# MT-001: Math and rounding correctness

**Risk**: Data loss/logic error

**When to check:** Mandatory when numbers are shifted or rounded up or down

Place each step defined below into TodoWrite.

**Mandatory math validation:**
- step 1: read entire function
  - Add function to TodoWrite
  - Output: function name, and a random line from anywhere in the definition
    - you must prove you read the function
- step 2: check all shift/rounding operations in modified functions, even if they didn't change
  - Add every shift/rounding operation into TodoWrite
  - Output: quote the actual code snippet and its location
- step 3: when shifting or rounding, ensure unaligned data not lost
- step 4: verify loop controls with rounding don't stop too soon
- step 5: check alignment of both memory AND size fields
- step 6: use DIV_ROUND_UP when needed, not size >> PAGE_SHIFT for rounding up

**After analysis:** Issues found: [none OR list]
